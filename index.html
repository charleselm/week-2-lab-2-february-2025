    <h2>Things I Like To Do</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies that I love to do in my free time. I've always been drawn to Japanese culture and a lot of my hobbies stem fromthis interest. I love watching Anime and reading Manga comics as well as playing related games. I also love anything related to stationary! I've been a bartender for the last 7 years and over the years I've picked up the hobbiy of Mixology as well.</p>
